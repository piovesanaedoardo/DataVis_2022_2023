# Data Visualization Project_2022_2023
The FIFA World Cup is a globally celebrated sporting event with a rich history and immense popularity. 
Our motivation for choosing this particular task/application field is twofold. 
Firstly, the World Cup dataset provides a diverse range of information, including match results, player statistics, 
and tournament details, which can be effectively visualized to gain insights into the game's evolution over time. 
Secondly, the World Cup captures the attention of millions of fans worldwide, making it an exciting and relatable subject for data visualization. 
The data is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup).

In this project, me and my colleagues have created a data visualization dashboard for the FIFA World Cup. This dashboard is a web application that allows users to explore the data and gain insights into the game's evolution over time. The dashboard is divided into three main sections:
- **World Cup Overview**: This section provides an overview of the World Cup's history and statistics
- **World Cup Players**: This section allows users to explore the players' statistics
- **World Cup Matches**: This section allows users to explore the matches' statistics

We have used the following tools and technologies to create this dashboard:
- **Python**: We have used Python to preprocess the data and create the visualizations.
- **Streamlit**: We have used Streamlit to create the web application.
